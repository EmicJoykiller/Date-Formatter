"Learn the Date Object by Building a Date Formatter"
This project is an engaging web application focused on understanding and utilizing the Date object in JavaScript. Users can view today's date in different formats, including "Day, Month, Year," "Year, Month, Day," and "Month, Day, Year, Hours, Minutes." The application dynamically updates the displayed format based on user selection via a dropdown menu.

The interface is designed with a modern and minimal aesthetic, using CSS variables for consistent theming and responsive design to ensure usability across devices. The application demonstrates the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling, and date formatting logic. Its structured codebase and clean UI serve as an excellent example for developers aiming to enhance their understanding of web development concepts.
